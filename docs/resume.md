# Summary

As an experienced full stack developer, I’m equally comfortable developing on the frontend and backend, collaborating with others on design and strategies, discussing solutions with stakeholders, and deploying products. When I’m not actively engaged in projects I’m refining my development process, refactoring for efficiency, and researching new tools. I’m seeking out a role where my experience and existing skills can make a direct contribution as quickly, but also provide me with new challenges to continue to grow as a developer and a leader.
