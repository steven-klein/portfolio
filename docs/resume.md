# Summary

An experienced full stack developer who’s equally comfortable developing on the frontend or backend, collaborating with others on design and strategies, discussing solutions with clients, and deploying products.  When I’m not actively engaged in projects I’m refining my development process.  I’m seeking out a role where my experience and existing skills can make a direct contribution as quickly as possible, but also provides me with new challenges to continue to grow as a developer.  I’m looking forward to working with talented individuals across the entire stack where I hope to be as inspirational to them as they surely will be to me.
