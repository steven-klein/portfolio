# E-commerce

The global reach and ubiquity of E-commerce makes it a cornerstone of the modern web, so it's only fitting that every developer spend time understanding it's concepts.  I've helped maintain and build on current platforms, and in a wave of entrepreneurship I even founded a company that leverages E-commerce as one of it's core services.

## [The Local Collaborative](https://thelocalcollaborative.com)

As Co-founder and CTO of The Local Collaborative I designed, developed, and deployed all aspects of the current platform.  Still in it's early stages and growing pains rapid development and an ability to adapt to market changes has been important.  This project has been incredibly challenging as I'm not just focused on development, but also growth, marketing, and funding.

__Highlights__  
My partner and I started this project as she was finishing her MBA, and our first work on the concept continuously had us seeking funding to create the vision.  The experience of pitching an idea to potential investors has been nerve-racking, but extremely rewarding.  Despite some setbacks while attempting to secure funding, we've persevered, by simply saying we have the skillset let's just build it, and that's exactly what we did.  At the minimal cost of some AWS services and mostly our time, we created the product and found some small successes in both consumer and B2B markets as we continue to refine it.

## [Missingink Shop](https://missinginkshop.com)

Missingink Shop has been hosting custom themed storefronts for it's clients for years, but one question always stuck, how do I put the store on my website?  Realizing the benefits of reduced overhead in maintaining custom store themes, as well as easing the burden on the servers we developed a platform that allows Missingink's clients to drop their store right into their sites.  I collaborated on the design of the API, and created a JavaScript application in Vanilla JavaScript that makes it easy as a copy and paste to embed a store in a website.

As a companion application, I created a [snippet builder](http://mi-script-builder.brkstn-dev.com/) that makes it easy for clients to create a snippet with a few custom options for setting various styles and a live preview.

__Highlights__  
Writing the store drop in with Vanilla JavaScript was an additional challenge that I felt was absolutely necessary since I was keen on avoiding dumping duplicate libraries on sites.  The availability of this JavaScript has made it very simple for default stores to exist, when a client doesn't have a website of their own.  Additionally, while the snippet has a handle full of options for colors and features it can also inherit a sites styles or be completely restyled with custom CSS.
