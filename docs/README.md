I've been a full-stack developer based in Nashville, TN for nearly five years.  Over the course of my career I've contributed to every part of the stack and continue to do so on a daily basis.  I've collaborated on numerous projects spanning various industries and media, and I'm constantly adding to and improving my skill set.

Here you'll find just a handful of projects, libraries, scripts, and tools I've built along with a little insight into what I've learned over the years and where my interests lie.

_Note: Some projects do not have direct links as they may be behind account walls or were intended for internal use only.  If you'd like to see any further code samples or sandboxed demo's please contact me._
